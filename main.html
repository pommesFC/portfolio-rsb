        Hi, I'm Rohit Sharma Bhusal, a 20-year-old international student in
        Germany currently attending Studienkolleg (T-Kurs), a preparatory course
        that serves as a stepping stone towards my bachelor's degree. Originally
        from Nepal, My Studienkolleg experience, connecting with students from
        various backgrounds has expanded my worldview, fostering an appreciation
        for cultural diversity and a deep understanding of global perspectives.
      </p>

        This website is my dynamic playground—a space where I translate
        self-taught web development skills into practical expertise.
        Experimenting with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript, I turn my
        theoretical knowledge into interactable entities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond academia, my interests span the worlds of football and cricket
        ((I'm an avid FC Barcelona follower)) and the enchantment of movies.
        Engaging in conversations is where I find joy, especially when delving
        into topics like physics, technology, existence, and purpose. Feel free
        to reach out—I'm open to discussions, eager to hear your views, and
        always up for learning something new.
